# cookiecutter-python-lib

My own, opinionated cookiecutter template for a Python library.

There are many other, excellent cookiecutters available, eg:

- [https://github.com/simonw/python-lib/tree/main]
- [https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage/]

## Usage

Make sure you have [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) installed, eg
using pipx:

```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```

Then run cookiecutter pointed to this repository:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:simw/cookiecutter-python-lib
```
